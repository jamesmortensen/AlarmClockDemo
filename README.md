# AlarmClockDemo

This is a sample project where we will wrote some code to handle cases where we want to wake up at 7am on the weekdays, 10am on the weekends, unless we're on vacation.

If we're on vacation, then we will have the alarm go off at 10am. But if it's a weekend and we're on vacation, then the alarm will go off not at all.
